# Blockchain From Scratch

Welcome to my blockchain project! This repository contains a custom-built blockchain developed using Python, Flask, and JavaScript. It incorporates essential blockchain functionalities, ensuring secure and reliable transactions.

## Overview

This project aims to demystify blockchain technology by building one from scratch. It includes key features such as Proof of Work, multi-node support, and conflict resolution. Additionally, it ensures secure transactions through RSA encryption and wallet implementation using public/private key encryption.

## Features

- **Proof of Work:** Implements a consensus algorithm to secure the network.
- **Multiple Nodes:** Supports adding multiple nodes to the blockchain network.
- **Conflict Resolution:** Resolves conflicts to ensure data consistency across the network.
- **Secure Transactions:** Uses RSA encryption to secure transactions.
- **Wallets:** Designed wallets utilizing public/private key encryption for secure and efficient transaction management.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core programming language for blockchain logic.
- **Flask:** Web framework for building the API.
- **JavaScript:** Frontend scripting for interactive features.
- **HTML & CSS:** For creating a user-friendly interface.
- **Cryptography:** For implementing RSA encryption and securing transactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- JavaScript-enabled browser

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khandelwaly940/blockchain-from-scratch.git
   cd blockchain-from-scratch
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have Python and Flask installed:

   ```bash
   pip install Flask cryptography
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask Server:**

   ```bash
   python blockchain.py
   ```

2. **Access the Application:**

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to interact with the blockchain.

## Usage

- **Create a Transaction:** Use the web interface to create and submit transactions.
- **Mine a Block:** Mine a new block to add the transactions to the blockchain.
- **Add Nodes:** Connect multiple nodes to the network and synchronize the blockchain.
